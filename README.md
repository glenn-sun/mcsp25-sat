# How to solve an NP-complete problem

This repository contains examples and homework template code for the course "How to solve an NP-complete problem'" at Canada/USA Mathcamp 2025. The course is an introduction to SAT and SMT solving, including reductions, algorithms, and lower bounds. These examples and homework exercises assume familiarity with Python 3. 

## Getting started

Install Python 3, then install the Z3 solver using:

```
pip install z3-solver
```

Find the lecture examples and homework in the appropriate folders. 

## Syntax reference

To learn the syntax of the Z3 solver, taking a look at the examples should be sufficient. If you have more questions, the full Z3 documentation can be found at https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/z3.z3.html.
